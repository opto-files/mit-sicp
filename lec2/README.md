;;This is not BASIC

Recursion is fucking crazy, holy shit.

Passing functions as arguments is super cool. I still don't get why they don't call them functions but its fine.
I guess at least just using 'define' to make name everything emphasizes that variables and functions are all the same thing in Lisp.

Oh okay, so he reckons "function is a mathematical world which implies mapping something to some other thing".
Seems like pretty much what procedures do though but okay.
